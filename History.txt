fsdb 0.6.0

- Replaced ftools with fileutils.

- Released as a gem using Mr. Bones.

fsdb 0.5

- If ruby is 1.8.2 or later, flock doesn't block other threads, so accessing
  FSDB databases from a multithreaded app doesn't have to use a lock polling
  hack in file-lock.rb. This results in a 12%-17% speed boost. No change to
  user code is required.

- Added a _load_ argument to Database#delete, with default +true+. If the
  _load_ argument is +false+, delete the object from the db without
  loading it or yielding.

- Replaced #id with #object_id.

- For ruby 1.9 compatibility, replaced use of class variables (@@cache and
  @@cache_mutex).

fsdb 0.4

- Fixed a problem that caused nested transactions to fail on windows. (The
  source of the problem is that there is no way to calculate a unique file
  id on Windows, and File::Stat#ino always returns 0. The workaround is to
  use the file path, although it might not be unique, due to links on NTFS
  or Samba, for instance. FSDB does try to use a canonical version of the
  path.)
  
  This fix also improves the speed of db access on windows.

- Disable the fcntl-lock extension on systems that do not already have flock.
  (It still works on linux, which is where it is useful, since it allows locking
  over NFS mounts.)

- Fix for file locking on Win 95/98/ME: File#lock_exclusive and
  File#lock_shared always just use LOCK_EX on those OS's. Thanks to
  Matija Kejzar for reporting this.

- Added examples/indexes.rb to show use of rbtree indexes of objects in a db.
  (Requires that rbtree be built and installed separately.)

fsdb 0.3

- Improved error handling and exception classes. More Errno exceptions are
  now translated into FSDB-specific informative error classes, or handled
  internally as appropriate.

- test/test-formats.rb

- bench/bench.rb

- Fixed a bug that caused the absolute path to be used instead of the
  database-relative path when searching for the Format matching the path.

- Since YAML is now standard with ruby, the YAML_FORMAT is now standard
  with FSDB, and requiring 'fsdb/formats/yaml' is no longer needed.

- format mapping example in examples/formats.rb.

- drb client-server example in examples/client.rb and examples/server.rb.

- browse, edit, etc. no longer require a block

- Database.[] shortcut for Database.new

- rewrote test/test-concurrency.rb so it can run on windows. (Note
  that the benchmark times come out a bit slower now, as a result,
  even though FSDB itself is not slower.)

- test/test-fsdb.rb improved.

- Windows fixes (to the point of being usable but still not perfect).

- BINARY_FORMAT template.

fsdb 0.2

- Updated to ruby 1.8.1.

- Fixed a concurrency bug that allowed a write thread and another
  thread to access a file at the same time.

- Added option for fcntl locking, thanks to Ara Howard.

fsdb 0.1

- First public release.
